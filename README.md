**Assignment B3**
For this assignment, the user has opted to add features to Dean Attali's Shiny App Demo (https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/) which is **OPTION A** for the given assignment.

**Features added:**

1. **Theme** Using the **shinythemes** package, I have added the "sandstone" theme to the app. This feature could be useful for better readability and also for aesthetic purposes for the app.

2. **Image** I have added an image to the UI next to the title to make the app more informative and for aesthetic purpose.

3. **Plot and table panel** I have seperated the plot and table into two different panels so there is no overcrowrding of information for the user. Depending on what they wish to view, ie. the plot or the table, the user can navigate accordingly.

4. **Interactive table** I have made the table interactive so the user can explore the different liquor options by sorting with more ease.
